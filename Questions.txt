Q: Why override operator new instead of using malloc?
A: Most modern C++ uses new/delete. Overriding these catches real-world leaks in user code.

Q: How do you avoid infinite recursion?
A: Use `malloc()` and `free()` internally instead of calling `new`/`delete` within the custom operators.

Q: Why use preprocessor macros?
A: To automatically capture file and line information at the call site for better debugging.

Q: What happens if memory isn't freed?
A: It remains in the hash map and gets reported as a leak by `reportLeaks()`.

Q: How is this different from Valgrind?
A: This is a simple educational tool. Valgrind is production-grade, handles all memory issues, and includes threading support.
